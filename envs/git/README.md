# Git

Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system. See
[Git](https://git-scm.com) for more details.

This shell environment configuration allows you to build Git and its
documentation, as well as run its tests.

## Building Git

Run `make` from the Git repository's root directory.

## Building Git documentation

Run `make` from the `Documentation` directory.

## Running Git tests

Run `make` from the `t` directory to kick off the full test suite.
Alternatively, the individual test scripts can be run directly.

See [t/README.md](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/t/README) for more
details.
